Simple local file backups with a bit of compression

loppel creates backup copies of files and directories right where they are
â€“ just add `.bak`, `.bak.d`, or `.tar.zstd` if you need them smaller. No cloud,
no complicated configs, just quick local copies when you need them.

Perfect for that "let me backup this config before I break it" moment or
"I should save a copy before I try this" situation. Restores are just as
straightforward, and optionally clean up after themselves.

Think of it as cp with a bit more smarts about what you're copying and how
you might want it compressed.
